## Introduction
Email spam detection is a crucial task in natural language processing. This project aims to build a model that can accurately classify emails as spam or ham based on their content.

## Features
- Preprocessing of email text data
- Feature extraction using techniques like TF-IDF
- Machine learning models for classification
- Evaluation metrics to assess model performance

## Installation
To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mdadnanafzal/email-spam-ham-detection-.git
cd email-spam-ham-detection-
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To run the spam detection model, use the following command:

```bash
python spam_ham_detector.py
```

You can also test the model on your own email data by running:

```bash
python test_model.py --email_path path_to_your_email
```

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model consists of labeled emails. Ensure you have the dataset in the correct format before running the training script.

## Model
The model is based on machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or other classifiers. Feature extraction is performed using techniques like TF-IDF to convert text data into numerical features.

## Results
The results of the model, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, can be found in the `results` directory.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you have any suggestions or improvements, please create a pull request or open an issue.
